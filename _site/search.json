    "text": "The tidyverse is a collection of R tools, which we call packages, that were designed to be easy to use, easy to read, and work well together. To understand the tidyverse, we need to know some of the history of R.\n\n\nR was created in 1993 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland. It was designed as a tool to teach statistics, and it’s been widely adopted by the field of biology. Over time many people have developed R packages - packages can be approximately thought as like apps on a phone - which focus on specific analyses. For example, if you want to identify differentially expressed genes using RNA-seq data, there is an R package that can perform various statistical tests and normalisation steps. Actually, there are lots of packages that will do this, and the hard part is choosing which one to use. All of these packages are developed by the community, which is great, and initially they were all written in what we call “base R”.\nBase R, and all the R packages that were developed using it, are a bit like the English language: for those who grew up with it, it’s beautifully flexible, expressive, and intuitive. For anyone learning English as an adult…why on earth is there a “g” in night? (Or a “k” in knight, for that matter). Base R packages, like the English language, are a mix of styles and formats depending on who wrote them.\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse is a series of packages that have been designed from the ground up to work together, using a consistent, logical style. It’s written to be human readable, intuitive, and easy to learn. The tidyverse is highly popular and is well documented. My personal opinion: if I was going to learn R now, I would choose to focus on learning the tidyverse.\nThe tidyverse is also a mindset about how data should be presented and stored. Data is “tidy” if:\n\nEach variable is stored in a column (variables could be Age, Height, Occupation).\nEach observation is stored in a row (here, observations could be individuals).\nTogether, these rows and columns form a table.",
