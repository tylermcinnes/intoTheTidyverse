Maybe this is your first encounter with R, or maybe you've self-taught and stumbled your way through a plot, or maybe you've been using base R for ages and you want to pick up some of the tidyverse (that's where I fit in, by the way). Whatever your situation, this workshop is going to introduce you to the tidyverse, get you started with some exercises, and then set you loose with enough tools to explore things comfortably (and safely) on your own.
